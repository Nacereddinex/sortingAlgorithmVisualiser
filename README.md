# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a web application built with React that allows you to visualize different sorting algorithms in action. The app provides a visual representation of an array of bars, where each bar represents a value, and the height of the bar represents the magnitude of the value. You can observe how various sorting algorithms rearrange the bars to sort the array in ascending order.

## Features
* Bubble Sort: Visualize the bubble sort algorithm step by step.

* Insertion Sort: Visualize the insertion sort algorithm step by step.

* Adjustable Array Size: Use the slider to change the number of bars in the array.

* Disable Buttons: The sorting buttons are disabled while a sorting algorithm is running to prevent conflicts. 


## Limitations
* Limited Sorting Algorithms: The app currently supports only Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. 
Additional sorting algorithms can be added in the future to enhance the learning experience.

* Simplistic Design: The user interface is minimalistic and focused on functionality. Further improvements can be made to enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the app.

* Lack of Sorting Speed Control: The current implementation has a fixed delay between each step of the sorting algorithm. Adding a speed control slider can provide users with the ability to adjust the sorting speed according to their preference.

## Future Improvements
* Enhanced Visualization: Improve the visual representation of the sorting algorithms by adding animations and transitions to provide a more engaging and intuitive visualization.
* Additional Sorting Algorithms: Introduce more sorting algorithms such as , Quick Sort, and Selection Sort to provide a wider range of algorithms for visualization and comparison.
* Speed and Complexity Comparison: Include a comparison of the sorting algorithms' speed and complexity to help users understand the trade-offs between different algorithms. This can include information about time complexity (e.g., Big O notation) and comparisons based on empirical testing with varying array sizes. 
* Advanced Customization: Allow users to choose different color schemes, sorting speed, and other customization options to tailor the visualization to their preferences.

* Responsive Design Enhancements: Make further improvements to the app's responsiveness and layout to ensure a seamless experience across different devices.
